## Why this ?

This model was created because of one [Darrshana](https://github.com/Darrshana) who wanted to use multiple emojis in sequence, to easily convey with others. So, thus incepted the idea of making gifs out of the emojis typed out.

## How this ?

The tech stuff used are as follows:

1. [JoyPixels](https://www.joypixels.com/) to convert the emoji to images, and it also lets you convert :smile: to 😄.
2. [GifShot](https://github.com/yahoo/gifshot) to convert the images into a gif.
